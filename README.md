# Epic RPG Discord Dungeon Helper

A **Discord bot** for automatically solving and assisting with high-level Epic RPG dungeons (D10‚ÄìD15), with advanced logic for D13, D14, and D15.  
Supports both classic `rpg dungeon` message-based runs and `/dungeon` slash commands.

- ‚è≥ **D15 & D15.2 Support:**  
  - External solver integration for Time Dragon dungeons, including board state and move simulation.
  - Verifies solver outputs, can retry for valid solutions, and applies move effects for full simulation.

- ‚öîÔ∏è **General Features:**
  - **Multi-dungeon:** Supports D10‚ÄìD15 helpers, with flexible channel-based enable/disable.
  - **Slash Command Compatible:** Seamless support for both classic and slash dungeons.

    - Copy `settings_example.py` to `settings.py` and edit your bot token, allowed channels, and other config as needed.
    - Add your Discord bot credentials and set channel IDs for each dungeon helper.

4. **(Optional) Build/Download Solvers:**
    - For D14/D15: Place compiled solver binaries in `dungeon_solvers/D14/` and `dungeon_solvers/D15/` as required.

## Technical Overview

### Main Components

- `main.py` ‚Äì Event loop, message & embed handlers, command router.
- `dung_helpers.py` ‚Äì Dungeon logic for D13‚ÄìD15; action selection, state, solver interface.
- `settings.py` ‚Äì Bot config: IDs, allowed channels, dungeon helper state.
- `utils_bot.py` ‚Äì Helper utilities: dungeon detection, permissions, bot interaction.
- `dungeon_solvers/` ‚Äì External binaries for advanced dungeon pathfinding.

### D13 Helper Logic

- **Game Phases:**  
  D13 is divided into 4 main steps, auto-detected from board state (`room_number`, `dragon_room`).
- **Answer Selection:**  
  The bot parses the question/answers and picks the right answer using logic from `get_d13_action` and `get_answer`.
- **Recovery:**  
  If the user makes a mistake, the bot recalculates phase from the current embed, and shows a friendly message.
- **Deduplication:**  
  The bot ensures each state is only answered once per room/question combo.

### Other Dungeons

- **D14 & D15**  
  Call external binaries to compute optimal moves, parse board state, and respond via Discord.
- **D15.2**  
  Handles special phase 2 mechanics and advanced move simulation.

---

## Usage

- Start a dungeon as usual (`rpg dungeon` or `/dungeon`).
- The bot will detect D13‚ÄìD15 dungeons and post the correct moves in the configured channel.
- For D13: The bot will always recover from mistakes, show which move to pick, and increment turn count.
- For D14/D15: Interactive helpers, external solvers, and Discord UI buttons are available.

---

## Configuration

- **Per-dungeon channel enable:**  
  In `settings.py`, edit the `DUNGEON13_HELPERS`, `DUNGEON14_HELPERS`, etc., to control which channels each helper is active in.

- **Slash command compatibility:**  
  The bot auto-detects whether the run is classic or slash and responds accordingly (edit in-place or send a new message).
